# World_Weather_Analysis
This project was to collect weather data from cities around to world to allow travelers to find vacation destinations based on maximum and minimum temperatures.  After the traveler enters their maximum and minimum limits the program displays a map of cities matching the selection criteria.  

Also included in this project is a tentative itinerary for a four city tour, including current weather information and recommended hotels.
